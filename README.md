git print check
===============
Check your code for print statements before committing.

Installation
------------
Make install.sh executable, and then run it.

>`chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`

The install script moves `_git_print_check.d` to `~/.git_print_check.d` and adds the contents of `_bashrc` to `~/.bashrc`.
